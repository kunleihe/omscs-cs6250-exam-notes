# Lesson 8: SDN (Part 2)

- Describe the three perspectives of the SDN landscape.
    - A plane-oriented view (management, control, data plane)
    - The SDN layers
    - A system design perspective

- Describe the responsibility of each layer in the SDN layer perspective.
    ![SDN Layers](/images/lesson8_sdn_layers.png)
    - Management plane *defines* network policy
    - Control plane *enforces* networsdk policy
    - Data plane *executes* network policy

- Describe a pipeline of flow tables in OpenFlow.
    - Each entry of a flow table has three parts: 
        - a matching rule
        - actions to be executed on matching packets
        - counters that keep statistics of matching table 
    - When a packet arrives, the look up process starts in the first table and ends either with a match in one of the tables of the pipelines or with a miss.

- What’s the main purpose of southbound interfaces?
    - It seperates the control plane and data plane

- What are three information sources provided by the OpenFlow protocol?
    - Event-based messages that are sent by forwarding devicecs to the controller when there is a link or port change
    - Flow statistics are generated by forwarding devices and collected by the controller. This allows for quality of service (QoS) policies to be implemented.
    - Packet messages are sent by forwarding devices to the controller when they do not know what to do with a new incoming flow (e.g., does not match any rules)

- What are the core functions of an SDN controller?
    - Topology, statsitics, notifications, device management, shortest path forwarding, security mechanisms

- What are the differences between centralized and distributed architectures of SDN controllers?
    - Centralized controllers: a single entity manages all forwarding devices. This single point of failture may have scaling issues.
    - Distributed controllers: a centralized cluster of nodes or physically distributed set of elements. Two properties: weak consistency semantics and fault tolerance.

- When would a distributed controller be preferred to a centralized controller?
    - When we care about scalability

- Describe the purpose of each component of ONOS (Open Networking Operating System) a distributed SDN control platform.
    ![ONOS](/images/lesson8_onos.png)
    - Several ONOS instances running in a cluster. The management and sharing of the network state across these instances is achieved by maintaining a global network view.
    - The applications use information from the view to make forwarding and policy decisions and update these decisions backto the view.
    - Titan (a graph database) and Cassandra (distributed key value store) are used to implement the view. The applications interact with the network view using the Blueprints graph API.
    - Zookeeper is used to maintain the mastership between the switch and the controller.
    
- How does ONOS achieve fault tolerance?
    - ONOS redistrubutes the work of a failed instance to other remaining instances. 
    - Once an ONOS instance fails, an election is held to choose a master of each of the switches controlled by the failure instance.

- What is P4?
    - P4 is a high-level programming language to define how the switches operate in the data plane

- What are the primary goals of P4?
    - Reconfigurability: the controller can modify the way parsing and processing of packet take place in the switch
    - Protocol independence: the controller defines a packet parser and a set of tables mapping matches their actions to enable switches to be independent of any specific protocol
    - Target independence: the packet processing programs should be independent of the underlying target devices.

- What are the two main operations of P4 forwarding model?
    - Configure: to program the parser, specify the header fields, and define the order of stages
    - Populate: allows addition and deletion of entries in the table

- What are the applications of SDN? Provide examples of each application.
    - Traffic engineering: load balancing, minimizing power consumption
    - Mobility and wireless: interference management
    - Measurement and monitoring: traffic matrix estimation tool
    - Security and Dependability: DoS attach mitigation
    - Data center networking

- Which BGP limitations can be addressed by using SDN?
    - Routing only on destination IP prefix, no *flexibility* to customize rules based on the traffic application or the source/destination network
    - Networks have little *control* over end-to-end paths. Networks can only select paths advertised by direct neighbors

- What’s the purpose of SDX?
    - Application specific peering
    - Traffic engineering
    - Traffic load balancing
    - Traffic redirection through middleboxes

- Describe the SDX architecture.
    - SDX architecture replaces the traditional IXP's shared Layer 2 network and BGP route server
    - Each AS is given the illusion of having its own virtual SDN switch. This virtual switch connects the AS's border router to all participants, allowing the AS to define its own independent forwarding policy
    - The SDX is then responsible for combining these individual participant policies into a single policy that is implemented on the physical network switch.

- What are the applications of SDX in the domain of wide-area traffic delivery?
    - Application speific peering
    - Inbound traffic engineering
    - Wide-area sever load balancing
    - Rediction through middle boxes
